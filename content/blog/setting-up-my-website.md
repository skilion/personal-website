Hello world! 

Last week I got a back injury after a long streak of attending [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) sparring sessions. So I am now forced to take rest and I have decided to build my personal website to host my portfolio and blog.

In the past I would have built everything from scratch, which is fantastic to learn a lot. However it is quite stupid to waste 80% of my time reinventing the wheel and 20% writing actual content. So I have decided to give a go to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static website generator. So far I am quite impressed. It hits the sweet spot for me in terms of automation and flexibility. No doubt it is so popular.

Using a pre-made template is a breeze, however I want to customize it fully so I am writing my own theme from scratch.
