I've always loved opening toys to see how they works, and I've always loved computers.

As a kid, when the first computer entered my home I was amazed of its capabilities. It was like a window over a new world, one that was entirely built by humans---as opposed to God---and I could open it like any other toy. Unfortunately I could not even begin to grasp its complexity.

So I started a journey to learn more.

Computers have changed a lot since then, but I never lost the appetite to learn. Technology keeps evolving and new things come out every year. There is no chance to get bored of it.

I've got an almost unhealty obsession with understanding how things work, which means for me that software engineering is more fun than ever.

And I love electronics too.

Nothing gives me more satisfaction of software interacting with the physical world. Altough that is a space where I have much to learn.

If you are looking for someone who can understand complex systems (and simple ones), help building prototypes (from software to hardware), collaborate with different people on your team (from planners to developers to designers), we might make a good match.

Check out my CV, and let's talk. I'm based in London, United Kingdom.
